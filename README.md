## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!  üëã

I'm Sareh, a passionate Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience in AI/ML across both academia and industry. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with a strong focus on applying machine learning to address complex problems in the healthcare domain, developing impactful solutions that bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

I hold a Master‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science from Western University, where I developed a weakly supervised anomaly detection model for surveillance videos using a Two-Stream I3D Convolutional Network as my thesis. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), focusing on real-time tracking systems.
