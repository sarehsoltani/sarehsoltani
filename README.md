## Hi there üëã

I'm Sareh, a passionate Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience in AI/ML, spanning both academia and industry. I specialize in Computer Vision and AI for Healthcare, developing impactful solutions that bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with a strong interest in leveraging applied ML to solve challenging problems in the healthcare domain.

I received my Master‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science at Western University, where I developed a weakly supervised anomaly detection model for surveillance videos using a Two-Stream I3D Convolutional Network as my thesis. Prior to this, I got my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), focusing on real-time tracking systems.


About me:
- Master's in Computer Science from Western University.
- Experienced in Data Science and Machine Learning
- Skilled in Python, Pytorch, SQL, and R.
- Based in Toronto, ON, Canada.
